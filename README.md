# parking_spot_detection_and_counter

•	Designed and implemented a real-time parking spot detection system utilizing Computer Vision and a tailored machine learning model. Successfully identified and tallied unoccupied parking spots through video frame processing and a strategic masking approach, enhancing computational efficiency.
•	Optimized model efficiency by 95x by employing a frame processing interval of 15 seconds and selectively computing status updates solely for active areas, leveraging pixel differential analysis to discern changes and optimize processing.
